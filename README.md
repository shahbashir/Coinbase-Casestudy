# Coinbase Case study

## Title
Cryptocurrency Exchange.
In the year 2009, Bitcoin was created by an anonymous developer satoshi nakamoto. The first decentralized cryptocurrency has taken off since then. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. Since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created as well as exchanges to buy those currencies on.

# Landscape

## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
The CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong was asked if Coinbase was Tech or Finance company to which he responded with "There will always be a blend of these two in our culture. That being said, if we were forced to label ourselves as one of the two, we would be a tech company first. The reason is simple: technology is driving a ton of innovation and growth in the world today. When you think of the organizations that have changed the world in the last 20 years, how many are finance companies? We'll succeed against established players entering our space by being tech first.
But ultimately, we are neither one. We are something different and new: a crypto company."
##  What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
These are some mind-blowing facts about Crypto and how much has this domain grown over the years.

Trading on Coinbase is an extremely easy process and geared toward a beginner.

# Recommendations

## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
Coinbase has turned me into a satisfied customer but there is always room for improvement. Binance and Crypto.com both offer their native token on their platforms. This means you can trade it just like any other currency and generate a profit. The only native token Coinbase offers is USDT. A stable coin that does not go up or down. My reason for the suggestion is that Native tokens tend to their extremely well on exchanges. One Binance Coin is currently worth $500 worth right now.
## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
As stated above, history has shown that exchanges with their native token tend to generate at least half a billion extra in revenue. Also, that coin can be used to buy any type of currency just like Stable Doller.
## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Binance coin is used and built on the Binance blockchain. Coinbase can either build on their Blockchain or use a third party like Binance to built on theirs.
## Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Most Cryptos are built on their Blockchain and not all Blockchain are created equally. Those that have their Blockchain also have their native taken. Other currencies are built on top of those currencies. Binance and CRO token have proven that smart contracts are not necessary to have successful native currencies as long as the exchange is wildly successful. In this case, Coinbase is already one of the more successful exchange out right now.
